# Daily Performance Insight
## Overview
Welcome to my Daily Performance Insight project, an application designed to extract price and analyse the performance of financial instruments, including stocks, market indices, and cryptocurrencies. The application provides insights into daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and multi-year performance metrics and delivers the results via email. 
## How it works?
The application uses Python to extract data from Yahoo! Finance and utilises pandas to calculate the performance. The result is then automatically sent to me via Gmail every weekday. The application is deployed on the cloud using AWS Lambda for execution and AWS CloudWatch to trigger on a preset schedule.
## Purpose
I built this application to stay informed about market performance and track the daily performance of my portfolio and the stocks I am watching. As someone who does not follow market regularly, it helps me stay connected with market trends without the need for daily manual checks.
